    <section>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            PassPointX (“we”, “our”, or “the App”) is a secure password manager designed to help you safely store and manage your passwords.
            Your privacy and security are our top priorities. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use the App.

            <li>We do not access, share, or transmit your data to any third party.</li>
            <li>PassPointX does not require any account creation, sign-up, or login.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>

        <h2>4. Offline Usage</h2>
        <p>
            PassPointX works entirely offline, ensuring your data is never transmitted over the internet.
            This makes it fully secure and independent from online networks.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            The App may use certain third-party libraries (such as React Native Vector Icons or UI components)
            to enhance your user experience. However, these libraries do not collect or access your stored passwords.
            No analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs are implemented in the App.
